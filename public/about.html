    <h4>Hobbies & Interests</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading! I've been a voracious reader since I first learned how, often finishing 2+ books a week. My love of books motivated me to pursue a career
            in information -- how it's generated, how to best organize and manage it, and most importantly how it flows from source to user so it can 
            improve lives. For fun, I <em>love</em> fantasy novels and series -- the longer the better (the more dragons the better, too). 
            <p>Some non-fiction topics I frequently read about include:
           <ul>
                <li>History</li>
                <li>Neuroscience & Psychology</li>
                <li>Philosophy</li>
                <li>Spirituality & religion</li>
                <li>Self-help & self-improvement</li>
            </ul></p>
